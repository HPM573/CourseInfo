# Software Requirements

Please follow the instruction below to meet the software requirements of the course: 

1. Install [Python 3.7.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/) and create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
3. Install [PyCharm (Professional Version)](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). 
PyCharm professional is free for students. Request license from 
[here](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/). 
4. Follow these steps to select your Python interpreter in PyCharm: 
    1. Open PyCharm (close any open projects). 
    2. On the Welcome to PyCharm window, click on **Configure** (lower right) and 
        select **Settings** (on Mac, it is called **Preferences**).
    3. Select **Project Interpreter** from the left menu. To create a Project Interpreter, 
    click on the small grey **gear** on top right and select **Add**.
    From the left menu, select **System Interpreter**. The path to where the python is installed should be 
    already displayed in the text box next to Interpreter. If not, navigate to the folder where python is install. 
    On my computer it is "C:\Users\ry87\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32\python.exe". Click Ok
    4. In the next windows, we install the packages we need. Click on the small **+** button on the right.
     Search for **numpy** and select it. In the bottom of the page, select **Install to user's site packages directory**
      and then click on Install Package.
    5. Repeat the previous step for **scipy** and **matplotlib**. Click OK.
5. To update Python packages, follow the steps 
[here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installing-uninstalling-and-upgrading-packages.html),
 under Upgrading packages.
7. Do [Homework Assignment 0](https://classroom.github.com/a/e2KrcmLQ) to make sure everything has been installed correctly.
    **Note**: When you open HW0, go to File -> Settings, from the left menu, select 
    Project: HW_0->Project Interpreter and make sure you  see the packages you just installed. 
    If not, from the drop-down menu next to Project Interpreter, make sure the interpreter that we just defined 
    is selected. It should be something like "**Python 3.7** (C:\Users\ry87\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32\python.exe)".
